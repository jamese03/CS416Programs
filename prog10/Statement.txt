This assignment submission represents my personal effort on the assignment. 
I have received no code from any other person or source that is not 
acknowledged in the comments.

The following people provided technical knowledge and guidance to help me 
complete the assignment:

       the PAC Stephen helped me with the synchronization methods for the first part of the program, other students were present as he helped a few of us at the same time. He was also the main help behind the second part of the program.
